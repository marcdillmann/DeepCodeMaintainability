Art of Illusion v2.9.2

Copyright 1999-2012 by Peter Eastman

1. Instructions

The Java classes which make up Art of Illusion are packaged into several
.jar files: ArtOfIllusion.jar, which contains the main program, and various 
plugin files, which must be placed in the Plugins directory.  The source
files are organized in the same way.  There is one directory corresponding to
each .jar file, containing the source code for the classes which go into that
file.

You will also find an XML file corresponding to each .jar file.  These
are build scripts for use with the Ant build tool (available from
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  To build each file, simply invoke Ant on the
corresponding script.  For example,

ant -buildfile ArtOfIllusion.xml

You must build ArtOfIllusion.jar before building any of the plugins, since
their build scripts need to reference it when compiling.  The plugins can
be built in any order.  The scripts will automatically put the finished .jar
files into the correct locations.
